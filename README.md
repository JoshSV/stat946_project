# stat946_project
This object localization project was a collaborative effort between Hoatian Lyu, Josh Valchar, Sakif Khan, and Olivia Zhi that was completed to fullfill the requirements of STAT946 - Deep Learning at the University of Waterloo. 

In this repo one will find our Python implementation, heatmaps produced by our algorithm, and the bounding boxes that our algorithm produced on the ImageNet test set.
